1. Evaluate the Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media as the Primary Marketing Channel (10 marks)
Advantages:
Broad Audience Reach: Social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, have extensive user bases in Kenya. This allows companies to reach a diverse audience quickly and effectively. Viral marketing campaigns can significantly boost brand visibility.
Cost-Effective Marketing: Social media marketing is generally more affordable than traditional advertising methods. Companies can control their budgets, utilizing cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) models, which makes it accessible for businesses of all sizes.
Targeted Advertising: Platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer advanced targeting options, enabling companies to reach specific demographics based on age, location, interests, and behaviors. This targeted approach increases the likelihood of engagement and conversion.
Real-Time Customer Interaction: Social media allows for immediate communication with customers, enabling quick responses to inquiries and complaints. This interaction fosters customer loyalty and builds a community around the brand.
Creative Content Opportunities: Platforms like TikTok and Instagram provide unique avenues for creative expression through videos, stories, and reels. This can engage users more effectively than static content, leading to higher engagement rates.
Disadvantages:
Risk of Negative Publicity: Negative comments or reviews can spread rapidly on social media, potentially harming a brand’s reputation. A single dissatisfied customer's post can attract widespread attention, necessitating immediate crisis management.
Data Privacy Concerns: The collection and use of customer data for targeted marketing can raise privacy issues. If users feel their data is being misused or not handled transparently, it can lead to distrust and potential legal issues.
Misinformation and Fake News: Social media can be a breeding ground for misinformation, which can mislead customers about the product or brand. Companies must actively monitor and manage their online reputation to counteract false information.
Dependence on Platform Algorithms: Changes in social media algorithms can affect the visibility of posts, impacting the reach and engagement of marketing campaigns. This unpredictability requires companies to continuously adapt their strategies.
Content Saturation: With so many brands competing for attention on social media, it can be challenging to stand out. High-quality, unique content is necessary, and creating this can be resource-intensive.
2. Analyze the Ethical and Legal Implications of Using Customer Data (10 marks)
Ethical Implications:
Transparency and Informed Consent: Companies must clearly communicate what data is being collected, how it will be used, and obtain explicit consent from users. This transparency builds trust and ensures ethical handling of personal information.
Data Security Measures: Implementing robust security measures to protect customer data from breaches is crucial. Ensuring data security helps build customer trust and upholds the company’s ethical responsibility to safeguard personal information.
Respect for User Privacy: Ethical marketing involves respecting users' privacy preferences and choices. Companies should provide users with options to control their data and how it is used.
Ethical Targeting Practices: Companies should avoid intrusive targeting practices that could be perceived as manipulative or overly aggressive in their marketing efforts.
Accountability and Responsibility: Businesses must take accountability for how they handle customer data and be prepared to address any data breaches or ethical lapses that occur.
Legal Implications:
Compliance with Kenya's Data Protection Act 2020: The Act mandates that companies obtain explicit consent before collecting personal data. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties and legal consequences.
Rights of Data Subjects: The Act ensures individuals have the right to access their data, request corrections, and demand deletion of their information. Companies must implement processes to facilitate these rights.
Data Minimization Principle: Only collect data that is necessary for a specific purpose. This not only complies with legal standards but also enhances trust among consumers.
Data Protection Officer (DPO): Appointing a DPO is essential for overseeing compliance with data protection laws and ensuring that all staff are trained on legal obligations.
Data Breach Notification Procedures: Companies must have clear procedures for notifying customers in the event of a data breach, as required under the Data Protection Act. This ensures that customers are informed and can take necessary precautions.
