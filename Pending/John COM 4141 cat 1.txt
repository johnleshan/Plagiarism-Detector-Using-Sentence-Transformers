Question 1: Evaluate the Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media for Launching the Product
Advantages:
1. Broad Audience Reach: Social media platforms, like Facebook and TikTok, have millions of users in Kenya, making it easy to reach diverse demographics. For instance, Facebook's vast user base allows the company to engage with a variety of customers, from young adults to older generations, enhancing brand visibility.
2. Cost-Effective Marketing: Social media offers cost-efficient marketing options compared to traditional media. For example, TikTok and Instagram Reels provide organic reach opportunities, allowing the company to save on advertising expenses while still creating high-engagement content.
3. Targeted Advertising: Platforms such as Facebook and Instagram allow targeting based on specific demographics like age, location, and interests. This means the company can reach audiences most likely to buy the product, improving conversion rates.
4. Engagement and Customer Interaction: Social media facilitates real-time interaction, allowing customers to provide instant feedback. This engagement is beneficial for customer service, addressing issues, and fostering loyalty, as brands like Safaricom do by promptly responding to queries on Twitter.
5. Influencer and Viral Marketing Potential: TikTok’s short-form video format makes it possible for campaigns to go viral, reaching a broad audience rapidly. Collaborating with Kenyan influencers on Instagram and TikTok could expand reach and create relatable, impactful content, as demonstrated by brands like Telkom Kenya.

Disadvantages:
1. Privacy Concerns: Using customer data on social platforms can lead to privacy issues, especially if not managed in line with Kenya's Data Protection Act, which requires clear consent and transparency. A breach could damage trust, as seen in Facebook’s previous data privacy controversies with Cambridge Analytica in the US 2016 elections https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal.
2. Reputation Management Challenges: Negative comments or misinformation can spread quickly, harming the brand. For instance, KFC Kenya faced backlash when a customer service incident was shared widely on social media, which required swift crisis management.
3. High Competition and Content Saturation: Social media is saturated with numerous brands competing for attention. The company may need to invest heavily in unique and creative content to stand out, which can be challenging in a crowded space.
4. Risk of Misinformation: Misleading or false information about the product could spread on platforms like Twitter, impacting customer perceptions. Managing misinformation and issuing timely clarifications would be essential to safeguard brand reputation.
5. Algorithm Dependency: Social media algorithms control visibility, and frequent algorithm changes on platforms like Instagram and TikTok can affect organic reach, requiring companies to invest more in paid promotions to maintain visibility.
Question 2: Analyze the Ethical and Legal Implications of Using Customer Data Collected Through Social Media
Legal Implications According to Kenya’s Data Protection Act, 2020:
1. Informed Consent Requirement**: Under the Act, companies must obtain explicit consent from customers before collecting personal data. This means the company should clearly inform users about how their data will be used, stored, and shared, ensuring compliance with Section 25 of the Act.
2. Data Minimization Principle: Data collected should be limited to only what’s necessary for the marketing purpose. For instance, if the data isn’t essential for the campaign, the company must avoid gathering it. This principle, outlined in Section 29, aims to protect users’ privacy by restricting unnecessary data collection.
3. Security Measures: Section 41 mandates that companies must implement robust security measures to protect personal data from breaches and unauthorized access. Using secure platforms, encrypting data, and restricting access within the company can help prevent data loss.
4. Rights of Data Subjects: Customers have rights under the Act, including accessing their data, rectifying inaccuracies, and requesting deletion. Setting up an efficient system to handle these requests ensures compliance and fosters customer trust.
5. Accountability and Penalties: The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner can impose penalties on companies that fail to comply with the Act. The company must maintain detailed records of all data processing activities to demonstrate compliance during audits.

Ethical Implications:
1. Transparency and Trust: Being open about data usage builds trust with customers. The company should clearly communicate its data policies on all marketing channels, showing a commitment to ethical practices.
2. Respecting Customer Autonomy: Allowing customers the choice to opt out of data collection respects their autonomy. This option should be easily accessible, especially for targeted advertising, to ensure ethical use of data.
3. Data Security: Ethically, the company has a duty to protect customer data, even beyond legal requirements. Employing strong data protection measures can prevent identity theft and data leaks.
4. Avoiding Data Manipulation: Using data only for the purposes disclosed prevents manipulation. For instance, using data for unintended marketing purposes without notifying the customer would be unethical and could lead to loss of trust.
5. Limiting Psychological Impact: Overuse of targeted ads can sometimes pressure customers or create unrealistic expectatio	ns. Limiting ad frequency and respecting user experience on platforms like Instagram and TikTok contributes to responsible advertising.
Question 3: Analyze Various Social Media Platforms and Recommend the Best Ones
Platform Analysis and Recommendations:
1. Facebook: With a broad user base across Kenya, Facebook offers extensive targeting options, which is valuable for reaching various demographics. Its advertising tools, including sponsored posts and Stories, make it versatile for promoting products to Kenyan audiences.
2. Instagram: Instagram’s visual nature is ideal for product-centric posts. Features like Reels, Stories, and IGTV can capture attention quickly, particularly for younger audiences. Given its growing popularity, Instagram offers substantial reach and engagement opportunities.
3. Twitter (X): Twitter allows for real-time engagement, making it excellent for customer service and reputation management. By responding to customer inquiries and feedback quickly, the company can build a responsive and transparent brand image.
4. TikTok: TikTok is a rising platform among Kenyan youth, particularly popular for short-form video content. Its unique algorithm promotes organic reach, making it suitable for launching creative campaigns that could go viral. Using TikTok influencers can also help the brand appeal to younger audiences.
5. LinkedIn: Although not typically a retail-focused platform, LinkedIn can be useful for B2B engagement if the company seeks partnerships or distributor connections. Posting professional content related to the business and product values can help establish credibility.

Recommended Platforms: 
- Primary: Facebook and Instagram, due to their large, diverse audiences and advanced advertising options.
- Secondary: TikTok for its viral potential and youth engagement, with Twitter (X) for real-time feedback management. LinkedIn may be useful for corporate partnerships if applicable.
